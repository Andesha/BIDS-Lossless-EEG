This data was user for "Deconstructing the early visual electrocortical responses to face and house stimuli" 2013: http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121634

The study was conducted at Brock University.

Experimental paradigm and Procedure:
Subjects viewed stimuli presented for 300ms with an inster-stimulus-interval of about 1 second. Stimulus images were either faces (upright or inverted), houses (upright or inverted) or half-circle checkerboards (left or right). The subjects were asked to respond as quickly as possible by pressing buttons with their left and right index fingers corresponding to the side of the checkerboard at onset.

Data aquisition:
EEG data acquired using 128 channel BioSemi ActiveTwo system with a custom cap montage.
